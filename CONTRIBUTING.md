# How to contribute

## Here are some important resources:
- [Crypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [JavaScript Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to Japanese-Learing with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
