# Web-Based-Learning
Using web scraping to learn relevant foreign words about a topic.
## The Idea
As I spend time learning Japanese and writing essays about specific topics, I find myself searching for
the appropriate terminology for the subject matter. For example if I am in need of a list of most common words for
the topic "Robot", checking out the wikipedia page is a decent place to start. I intend to sort the words most commonly used
on the wikipedia page, then display them with pronounciations, spellings, kanji, etc. on this site. Hopefully, it will 
become a helpful tool for progressing Japanese vocabulary, especially when the user wants to discuss a certain topic.
